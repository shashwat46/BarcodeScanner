# Barcode Scanner App üì±

An iOS application that scans barcodes in real-time, using SwiftUI and UIKit. The app integrates AVFoundation for accurate barcode scanning and provides custom error handling for a seamless scanning experience.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Real-Time Barcode Scanning:** Utilizes AVFoundation to capture and process barcode data instantly.
- **Error Handling with Custom Alerts:** Provides meaningful feedback with alerts for device input and scan validation errors.
- **Dynamic UI Updates:** Smoothly updates the interface based on scan results, ensuring a responsive user experience.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **SwiftUI:** Primary UI framework for declarative layouts.
- **UIKit Integration:** Used `UIViewControllerRepresentable` to bridge UIKit components with SwiftUI.
- **AVFoundation:** Core technology for real-time barcode scanning.
- **Custom Alerts:** Built-in alert system to notify users of device input errors and invalid scans.

## Requirements üìã

- **iOS 14.0+**
- **Xcode 12.0+**
- **Swift 5.3+**
